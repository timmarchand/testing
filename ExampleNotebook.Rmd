This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

You can copy and paste chunks over from other scripts in this course, and then write your own notes and reflections between the code. 

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Note that *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Exercise 1
```{r}
help(median)
?sd
?max
```

Your notes:


## Exercise 2
```{r}
#1. 
ceiling(18.33); signif(9488, 2)
#2. 
exp(1); log10(1000)
#3. 
sign(-2.9); sign(32)
#4. 
abs(-27.9) ; abs(11.9)
```

Your notes:

## Exercise 3
```{r}
# Calculate the `gross` by adding the `tax` to `net` amount
  net <- c(108.99, 291.42, 16.28, 62.29, 31.77)
  tax <- c(22.89, 17.49, 0.98, 13.08, 6.67)
  
  
```

Your notes:


# Chickweight data
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load tidyverse
suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse))
# Load the data
CW <- read_csv("ChickWeight.csv")
```

## Exercise 4
```{r}
# Plotting chick weight
ggplot(CW, aes(Time, weight)) + geom_point() 

# Switch the variables `Time` and `weight` in code used for the plot on the right?
# What do you think of this new plot compared to the original?
```


## Exercise 5
```{r}
# Adding jitter to the points
# Copy and paste the code below in a new code chunk
#Replace the `geom_point()` above with `geom_jitter()`. What do you observe?

ggplot(CW, aes(Time, weight, colour=Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Diet) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
